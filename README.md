# Simple-RPG-game
simple console rpg game written in C++

Project started back in 2012 from great book "C++ Programming for Games". Added to github to finish it. 

Modifications from exercises:
- Gold Modif - random gold reward
- Character Races - added races to classes
- Leveling up, depends on class
- Magic Points - added, increase depends on class
- spells
- Random Encounters During Rest 
- A Store (show, buy and sell) items, armor nad weapon
- Items (players inventory) use in combat
- Multiple Enemies


This is basic game but it can act as fundament for more complex game made eg. in Unity which probably will do in future.

I did not include any tests but I think it works ok, and anyways I didn't use any advanced desing patterns.
